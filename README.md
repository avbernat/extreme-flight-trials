# extreme-flight-trials
Climate change has led to more extreme temperatures and weather patterns, but the effect of these extreme changes has not been tested on Jadera haematoloma, the soapberry bug. Already a Florida insect affected by the human-introduction of a nonnative host plant called golden rain tree, the soapberry bug can also be subject to changes in temperature and relative humidity. In particular, I’m interested in how changes in temperature, relative humidity, and age affects the flight performance of soapberry bugs. As long-distance flyers (~14km in one bout and ~0.3 m/s an average speed), these insects can traverse between Florida’s mainland and islands, making it possible for gene flow to continue between the native host plant (found on the islands) and the nonnative host plant (found on the mainland). However, there could be migratory consequences for these insects if extreme temperatures and relative humidity induced by climate change stunts their flying capabilities. Here, I hope to test that hypothesis and display those results.
